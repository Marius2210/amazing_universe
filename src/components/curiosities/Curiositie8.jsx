        <h3>How many planets have been discovered?</h3>
        <p>
        Do you know how many planets have been discovered? As of August 20, 2022, there were 7,837 planets detected and only 5,151 of them confirmed in 3,800 systems. It may seem like too many, but if you take into account that there could be 100,000 million stars in our galaxy and that most of them have a planet orbiting around them every month, you realize that we are extremely far from getting to know them all. So for now it is estimated that only 0.0000008% of all the planets in the galaxy have been discovered.
