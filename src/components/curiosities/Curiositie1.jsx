        <p>
        The observable Universe is 93 billion light years in size. This means that, taking into account that light travels at a speed of 300,000 kilometers per second, it would take us all this time to cross it. Much longer than it has been in existence (13.8 billion years). In other words, it measures 10,000,000,000,000 kilometers.
