        <h3>A black hole has infinite density</h3>
        <p>
        Formed after the collapse of stars 20 times larger than the Sun, black holes are the most mysterious of celestial bodies. And it is that they are a singularity in space, that is, a point of infinite mass and without volume (something incomprehensible from our perspective), which means that its density is infinite, hence the gravity it generates is so incredibly high that not even light can escape its attraction.
