        <h3>How will the Universe die? Do you have a limit?</h3>
        <p>
        They are all theories. There are physicists who consider that the Universe is infinite, but others (the majority) that sooner or later will die. Now it is not clear how. Cooling down, being devoured by black holes, time stopping, tearing itself apart, contracting into an infinitesimally small point to originate a new Big Bangâ€¦ There are many exciting theories.
