        <h3>A supernova thousands of light-years away would extinguish life on Earth</h3>
        <p>
        A supernova is one of the most violent phenomena in the Universe. It is a stellar explosion that happens when a massive star (8 times bigger than the Sun) dies. In this explosion temperatures of 3 billion degrees are reached and gamma radiation capable of traversing the entire galaxy is emitted. If this happened in ours, it is possible that all life on Earth would die.
