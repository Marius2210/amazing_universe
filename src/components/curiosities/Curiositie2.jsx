        <h3>What you see is not what is, and what is you will not see</h3>
        <p>
        When you look at the sky, what you see is really what was happening in the past. Since light takes time to reach us, the image we see is the one projected by the cosmos long ago. Looking at the Moon, you see it as it was 1.2 seconds ago (not much has changed). When you see the Sun, you see it as it was 8 minutes ago and the nearest star as it was 4.2 years ago. Some stars you see today have been dead for hundreds of years.
