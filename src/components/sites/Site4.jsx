          A quasar or quasar (acronym for "quasi-stellar radio source", translation from English quasi-stellar radio source) is defined as either a newborn galaxy or that energy source that occurs in the black hole at the center of these galaxies. newborns, characterized by being an astronomical source of electromagnetic energy, which includes radio frequencies and visible light. Quasars appear in a huge black hole, which absorbs all the matter it finds in its vicinity. When this occurs, due to the enormous speed of rotation of the formed accretion disk, a gigantic amount of energy is produced, released in the form of radio waves, infrared, light, ultraviolet and X-rays, which turns quasars into the brightest and hottest objects in the known universe.

          The first quasars were discovered with radio telescopes in the late 1950s. Many were recorded as radio sources that had no corresponding visible object. Using small telescopes and the Lovell telescope as an interferometer, the objects were shown to have a very small angular size.
