          A supernova (pl: supernovae or supernovas) is a powerful and luminous explosion of a star. A supernova occurs during the last evolutionary stages of a massive star or when a white dwarf is triggered into runaway nuclear fusion. The original object, called the progenitor, either collapses to a neutron star or black hole, or is completely destroyed to form a diffuse nebula. The peak optical luminosity of a supernova can be comparable to that of an entire galaxy before fading over several weeks or months.

          The last supernova directly observed in the Milky Way was Kepler's Supernova in 1604, appearing not long after Tycho's Supernova in 1572, both of which were visible to the naked eye. The remnants of more recent supernovae have been found, and observations of supernovae in other galaxies suggest they occur in the Milky Way on average about three times every century. A supernova in the Milky Way would almost certainly be observable through modern astronomical telescopes. The most recent naked-eye supernova was SN 1987A, which was the explosion of a blue supergiant star in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite of the Milky Way.

          Supernovae can eject several solar masses of material at speeds of several percent the speed of light. This propels an expanding shock wave into the surrounding interstellar medium, sweeping up an expanding shell of gas and dust that is observed to be a supernova remnant. Supernovae are a major source of elements in the interstellar medium, from oxygen to rubidium. The expanding shock waves from supernovae can trigger the formation of new stars. Supernovae are a major source of cosmic rays. They can also produce gravitational waves, although gravitational waves have so far only been detected from mergers of black holes and neutron stars.
