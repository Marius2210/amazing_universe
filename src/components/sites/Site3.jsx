          A hypernova is a type of supernova produced when very massive stars (masses greater than 25 solar masses) collapse at the end of their lives. After exploding as a supernova, the hypernova's core would collapse directly into a black hole, emitting two extremely energetic jets of plasma from its poles at near-light speeds. These jets could generate powerful gamma rays and would be a possible explanation for gamma-ray bursts. Such massive stars are very rare, and therefore hypernovae would also be rare: it is estimated that an event of this nature can occur in our Galaxy every 200 million years. The star Eta Carinae, in our Galaxy, may be a hypernova candidate. Another good candidate to explode in a hypernova may be R136a1, discovered in July 2010 and with a staggering mass of 265 suns; also the Pistola star or LBV 1806-20 may be candidates to produce black holes tens or hundreds of thousands of years from now.

          In 1998 a hypernova was detected for the first time but the consequent gamma-ray burst was not observed. New studies of other hypernovae indicated that the gaseous blanket that covered some hypernovae sometimes prevented them from ejecting gamma radiation. That is why two types of hypernovae have been established: with jets and with smothered jets.
